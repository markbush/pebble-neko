# Pebble Neko

![Neko](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markbush/pebble-neko/master/resources/images/awake1.png "Neko") Port of Neko to Pebble watch

This is an initial version of Neko on the Pebble.  Neko has existed on many platforms over the years, including Windows, X11, Mac and iPhone.  Now, that lovable rascal comes to Pebble!

Ok, so the app doesn't do much, yet.  It's just a bit of nostalgia on your wrist.  I hope to add some colour options for Pebble Time and, maybe, I'll add some cat herding.

Do make use of what I've done, but please note that Neko was originally created to be free and freely available, so if you do something with Neko or this code, make what you do available to everyone, too!

Hope you enjoy!
